port-forwarding

## install

	$ npm install --save livelook

## api
### new LiveLook(args)
create a new `livelook` instance.

```javascript
// args
{
    username: '',
    password: '',
    server: 'server.slsknet.org',
    port: 2242, // port for server above, NOT the port we listen on
    waitPort: 2234, // port for peer server. will retry multiple options if fail
    sharedFolder: './mp3s',
    downloadFolder: './downloads',
    description: 'user biography',
    autojoin: [ 'chatrooms', 'joined', 'automatically' ],
    maxPeers: 100,
    uploadSlots: 2, // maximum uploads allowed at one time
    uploadThrottle: 56 * 1024, // speed to throttle uploads in bytes
    downloadThrottle: 56 * 1024
}
```

### livelook.init([done])
initialize our share list and connect to the soulseek server. you don't need to
call this if you just use login below.

### livelook.login([username, password, done])
login to the soulseek server, and initialize our peer server if it isn't
already. username and password are optional if the instance has them.

### livelook.refreshShareList([done])
re-scan `livelook.sharedFolder` and repopulate `livelook.shareList`. this is
what other users see when they browse us, or when we respond to searches.

### livelook.sayChatroom(room, message)
send a message to a chatroom.

### livelook.leaveChatroom(room)
leave a chatroom and stop receiving messages from it.

### livelook.joinRoom(room)
join a chatroom and start accepting messages from it.

### livelook.messageUser(username, message)
send a private message to a specific user.

### livelook.setStatus(status)
set our online/away status.

`status` can be a `Number` (1 for away, 2 for online), `'away'` or `'online'`.

### livelook.refreshUploadSpeed([done])
re-calculate our upload speed from [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/).

### livelook.getPeerAddress(username, done)
get a peer's ip address and port based on their username. done returns null if
no user is found, not an error.

### livelook.getPeerByUsername(username, done)
get a peer instance based on a username. this will first check our pre-existing
peers, then it tries to make a direct connection to the peer until finally
requesting the server connect the peer to us.

### livelook.getShareFileList(username, done)
get all the files a user is sharing. may take a while as some people share
large amounts of files, and the message must be decompressed.
